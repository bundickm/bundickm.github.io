I'm a data scientist living in Los Angeles, before that I spent 10+ years in leadership positions in the hospitality industry. I climbed from an entry level position to management by being able to understand, communicate, and execute on the streams of underutilized data. In those 10+ years I have used programming and data analysis to reduce costs, increase sales, and bolster marketing initiatives. I learned hands on that having data and seeing opportunities is not enough, you have to be able to sell your insights in an actionable plan and with a clear value incentivizing others to act.

As mentioned - I was in management, specifically operations, and that means I didn't get the luxury of playing with numbers all day. I have experience interacting with stakeholders at all levels of a company, both internal and external. I managed teams as large as 400+ down to teams of just a few individuals, succesfully developing many of them to move into leadership roles. I've also trained  existing teams as well as built an entirely new team to handle a multimillion dollar operation resulting in a 5% growth in sales within the first year.

I'm currently a Team Lead at Lambda School while also finishing out the curriculum. I help develop and guide new students, teaching them the foundations of data science which doubles to reinforce it for myself. When not working on the computer you can find me hiking (that's my dog and I on a hike in my profile picture), diving, playing boardgames, or watching movies. 

Feel free to reach out and we can have a chat.
