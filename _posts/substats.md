Better Sub Stats is a proof of concept project built in four days by a small team with the goal making data about subreddits digestible while improving the user experience compared to similar sites. Frontend, backend, and the underlying data science built from the ground up. [Explore the website here](https://bettersubstats.netlify.com/dashboard)
