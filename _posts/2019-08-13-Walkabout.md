Walkabout is a Python package to rapidly perform common exploratory data analysis on all features of a Pandas DataFrame. A single line of code is all you need to plot the distribution of all features, view detailed summary stats, find which feature interactions are likely to be important, and more. Walkabout is all about quick, easy discovery about your entire dataframe.
