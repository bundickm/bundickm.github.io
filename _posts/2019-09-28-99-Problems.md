Thinking of a single good project to work on is difficult. The staff members of Lambda Labs are tasked with thinking of dozens of projects every month, and that number increases with Lambda School's growth. 99 Problems is a project to explore automating some of that ideation process for the Lambda Labs staff. We ended up being able to generate fake company descriptions that can be used as the seed of full fledged projects for the students at Lambda School. Check out the [website here](https://ninenineproblems.com/) 
to see the end product or the [github repo here](https://github.com/labs15-pain-point).
