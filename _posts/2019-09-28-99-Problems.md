Thinking of a single good project to work on is difficult. The staff members of Lambda Labs are tasked with thinking of dozens of projects every month, and that number increases with Lambda School's growth. 99 Problems is a project to explore automating some of that ideation process for the Lambda Labs staff. We ended up being able to generate fake company descriptions that can be used as the seed of full fledged projects for the students at Lambda School.

# Planning and Research
Before diving into the project we set up some tools to aid our work. This included github with review controls, a Trello kanban board to manage our work in progress, and a Notion to house all of our planning and research documents. Once we had the basics out of the way we went on to researching, broad brainstorming, and stakeholder interviews. This led our team to the idea of using complaints on social media to identify problems that could then be solved with student projects. Further research along this vein, including an expert interview, led us to the conclusion that the social media data would be very dirty and the machine learning models needed would be complex and time consuming. Since we were looking to fail and iterate fast we pivoted away from this possible solution and onto company descriptions. Company descriptions on investment sites are roughly uniform in size, describe a problem, and generally describe a solution - fairly clean data to feed into our modeling.
