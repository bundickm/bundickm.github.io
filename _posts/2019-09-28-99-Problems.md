Thinking of a single good project to work on is difficult. The staff members of Lambda Labs are tasked with thinking of dozens of 
projects every month, and that number increases with Lambda School's growth. 99 Problems is a project to explore automating some of 
that ideation process for the Lambda Labs staff. We ended up being able to generate fake company descriptions that can be used as 
the seed of full fledged projects for the students at Lambda School. Check out the [website here](ninenineproblems.com) to see the 
end product or the [github repo here](https://github.com/labs15-pain-point).
